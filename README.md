# hello-world

Hi people lol.</b>
I'm Richard, just begun using git for real today and its been awesome!</b>
I'm a student of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri. Popularly known as FUTO in Imo State, Nigeria, Africa.</b>
This is exciting. So I'm currently trying to make a commit.</b>
Learnt today that a commit is actually just a fancy name for making a change on Github!</b>
So I'd end here for now so I could get back to learning some other new stuff. #Self improvement!
